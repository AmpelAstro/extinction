Test data
---------

This directory contains comparison files used in the tests.
These outputs from running the IDL procedure `FM_UNRED` from the
IDL Astro library: http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/pro/astro/
(`FM_UNRED` also requires the `CSPLINE` procedure.)

The script used to generate the output is included here.
